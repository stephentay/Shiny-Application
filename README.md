# Shiny Application

This **Shiny Application project** is part of Johns Hopkins University's course assignment requirement.

## About the App
The developed Shiny app can be found at https://stephentay.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

This app allows users to explore and understand four types of probability distributions:

1. Normal distribution
2. Uniform distribution
3. Exponential distribution
4. Log-normal distribution

Based on users' inputs, random data is generated. A histogram and a summary of the data would also be generated.

## Files in this Repo
This repo contains the following additional files:

1. **ui.R** which provides the R code for the user interface of the app.
2. **server.R** which provides the R code for the server component of the app.
