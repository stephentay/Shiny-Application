# Shiny Application

This **Shiny Application project** is part of Johns Hopkins University's course assignment requirement.

## About the App
The developed Shiny app can be found at https://stephentay.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

This interactive app allows users to explore and understand four types of distribution models:

1. Normal distribution
2. Uniform distribution
3. Exponential distribution
4. Log-normal distribution

Users can choose:

- Number of random datapoints to be generated
- The distribution model to be generated

Random datapoints are generated based on users' inputs. A **histogram** and **a summary of the data** are then displayed on the app.

## Files in this Repo
This repo contains the following additional files:

1. **ui.R** which provides the R code for the user interface of the app.
2. **server.R** which provides the R code for the server component of the app.
